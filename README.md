# University Managment System

## Overview
This project is an implementation of a university registry and managment system in C++. It has many functionalities for managing both members of the school and courses that are available and it follows object oriented design (the source code is seperated in source files .cpp and header files .h).

## What I Learned
- Practiced in C++ and object oriented programming.
- Deepened understanding in memory managment and pointers.
- How a real-world system is built in a mini scale.
